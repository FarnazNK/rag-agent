A production-style RAG agent built on LangGraph with hybrid retrieval, an
evaluation harness, regex guardrails, a FastAPI service, Prometheus metrics,
and a comparative benchmark suite.

Built as a portfolio project for AI engineering / ML platform roles. The
emphasis is on the surfaces a real production system needs — eval, observability,
deployment, guardrails — not just on getting an LLM to answer a question.

> **Note:** This is a personal portfolio project. The HR/IT/security corpus is
> synthetic and unrelated to any real organization, employer, or client.

## What's in the box

Six things, wired together:

1. **An agent** — a LangGraph DAG that routes queries, rewrites them for
   better retrieval, grades the retrieved context, and loops if the grade
   is poor. Topology, not a ReAct loop, so control flow is explicit and
   debuggable.
2. **A hybrid RAG pipeline** — dense (Chroma) + sparse (BM25) retrieval
   fused with reciprocal rank fusion. The vector store sits behind a
   `Protocol`, so swapping Chroma for Pinecone is one class.
3. **An eval harness** — YAML-defined test cases, four pluggable scorers
   (exact match, substring, retrieval recall, LLM-as-judge), a runner
   with Rich console output, JSON export, and a `--fail-under` threshold
   that makes it CI-ready.
4. **Guardrails** — regex-based PII detection (sanitize or block), prompt
   injection detection, output PII-leak detection, and source citation
   verification. Pluggable via the same `Protocol` pattern as scorers.
5. **A FastAPI service** — `POST /query`, `POST /stream` (Server-Sent
   Events), `GET /health`, `GET /metrics` (Prometheus). Guardrails wired
   into the request path.
6. **A comparative benchmark suite** — runs the eval dataset under multiple
   agent configurations side by side and produces a Markdown comparison
   table. This is what an eval framework is *for*: comparable numbers
   across changes, not one number in isolation.

A 60-document sample corpus (HR, IT, security, finance, engineering policies)
and a 23-case eval suite ship with the repo so the whole thing runs end to
end with one command.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone + install
pip install -e ".[dev,api,tracing]"

# Set API keys
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (for generation) and OPENAI_API_KEY (for embeddings)

# Generate the extended corpus (60 docs)
make corpus

# Run the API
make serve
# → http://localhost:8000/docs (interactive OpenAPI UI)

# Or run via Docker
make docker-up
```

Once the API is up:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How many PTO days do new hires get?"}'
```

```json
{
  "answer": "New hires accrue 15 PTO days per year for the first 2 years. [source: pto_policy.md]",
  "route": "retrieve",
  "iterations": 1,
  "chunks": [{"source": "pto_policy.md", "score": 0.92, "snippet": "..."}],
  "latency_ms": 1247.3,
  "run_id": "f7c2...",
  "guardrails": [
    {"name": "pii_detector", "action": "allow", "reason": "no pii detected"},
    {"name": "prompt_injection_detector", "action": "allow", "reason": "no injection detected"},
    {"name": "pii_leak_detector", "action": "allow", "reason": "no pii in output"}
  ]
}
```

CLI usage works too:

```bash
make ingest                                          # index the corpus
make ask Q='What does it take to get promoted?'      # ask, with --trace
make eval-fast                                       # run the eval suite (no LLM judge)
make benchmark                                       # run all configs side by side
```

The graph state (`AgentState`) is a Pydantic model that flows through every
node. Each node returns a partial-state dict; LangGraph merges the updates.

## Benchmark results

The point of an eval framework isn't to produce a single number — it's to
produce *comparable* numbers across configurations. The benchmark runs the
same 23-case dataset under five agent configurations and writes a comparison.

Run it yourself with `make benchmark`. Results below are from a representative
run on the 60-document HR/IT corpus (Claude Sonnet 4.5, OpenAI
text-embedding-3-small).

### Pass rate by config

| Config              | Pass rate | Notes                                                                |
|---------------------|----------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `baseline`          |       91% | All features on — hybrid retrieval, query rewrite, grading loop.     |
| `dense_only`        |       74% | BM25 disabled. Acronym queries (PIP, VPN, HSA, BYOD) regress sharply.|
| `no_query_rewrite`  |       83% | Skipping rewrite hurts paraphrase queries the most.                  |
| `no_grading`        |       78% | Without the grader, irrelevant first-shot retrieval is committed to. |
| `single_iter`       |       83% | Loop disabled; some recoverable failures become hard failures.       |

### Key findings

- **Hybrid retrieval is worth it.** The drop from `baseline` to `dense_only`
  is concentrated in queries with acronyms ("How long is a PIP?", "What VPN
  do we use?"). Pure dense embeddings semantically match documents that
  *talk about* PIP without containing the term. BM25 catches the literal
  keyword.
- **Query rewriting matters most for paraphrases.** "What's our company
  stance on unnecessary meetings?" is far from "meeting agenda required" in
  embedding space. The rewriter bridges the gap.
- **The grader earns its latency.** Without it, ~15% of cases that the loop
  could have recovered from become committed-to wrong answers.

The full per-case breakdown lands in `benchmarks/results/comparison.md`
after each run. The JSON output (`benchmarks/results/{config}.json`) is the
machine-readable version used by CI.

## API reference

OpenAPI / Swagger UI is auto-generated and served at `/docs`.

### `POST /query`

Synchronous one-shot RAG response. Input guardrails sanitize PII; prompt
injection attempts return 400. Output guardrails sanitize PII leaks and
unverified citations.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How long is parental leave?"}'
```

Response: `QueryResponse` (see `src/rag_agent/api/schemas.py`).

### `POST /stream`

Server-Sent Events stream. Useful for chat UIs that want to render tokens
as they arrive.

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How does code review work here?"}'
```

Event types:
- `event: node` — graph node lifecycle (`start` / `end`)
- `event: token` — streaming LLM tokens
- `event: done` — final answer + metadata
- `event: error` — terminal error

### `GET /health`

Liveness check. Reports corpus size, vector count, and whether tracing is on.

### `GET /metrics`

Prometheus exposition. Counters: `rag_agent_requests_total`,
`rag_agent_guardrail_blocks_total`, `rag_agent_guardrail_sanitizations_total`.
Histograms: `rag_agent_request_latency_seconds`, `rag_agent_loop_iterations`.

## Design decisions worth pointing at

A few places where I made a non-obvious choice and the reasoning behind it:

**Topology, not ReAct.** A ReAct-style "let the LLM decide what to do next"
loop is seductive but hard to evaluate — every failure mode looks the same.
An explicit graph makes the router, rewriter, and grader addressable as
separate components. You can measure router accuracy independently of
generation quality. You can swap the grader without touching the retriever.

**Hybrid retrieval, not pure dense.** Vector search is great for semantic
recall but fragile for acronyms, IDs, and exact product names — all of which
show up constantly in HR / enterprise queries ("what about PTO?", "find me
the PIP policy"). BM25 on the same corpus catches those. RRF is the cheapest
robust fusion method; the `k=60` constant is the default from Cormack et al.

**Grader with a fail-open policy.** If the grader's JSON output is malformed,
we treat the chunks as relevant rather than blocking the user. A broken grader
should not cause user-visible failures. It does get logged, loudly.

**Regex guardrails before model-based ones.** Three reasons: latency (sub-ms),
predictability (the eval suite needs deterministic behavior), and
auditability (a regex is reviewable; an LLM judge isn't). Model-based
guardrails belong on top of these, not instead of them.

**Sanitize, don't block, by default.** Most enterprise users want their
request to proceed with PII redacted, not be hard-blocked. Block only on
genuine integrity threats (prompt injection, intentional data exfiltration
attempts). Each guardrail has a `mode` knob.

**LangSmith is optional.** If `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` is set, traces flow there
automatically via LangChain's auto-tracing. If not, structured logs work
identically. Observability shouldn't be a hard dependency on a vendor.

**Lazy `Agent` import.** `from rag_agent import Agent` works, but the
top-level `__init__.py` uses PEP 562 lazy loading so importing
`rag_agent.schemas` doesn't drag in LangGraph. This matters for deployment
scenarios where the eval scorers run in a smaller environment.

**Scorers and guardrails are Protocols, not base classes.** Any callable
with the right signature qualifies. Adding a new metric or guardrail is a
function, not a subclass.

**SSE, not WebSocket, for streaming.** SSE is simpler, has built-in
reconnection, and works through every proxy. The trade-off is one-way
communication, which is fine for a Q&A agent. WebSocket would be the right
call if I needed bidirectional flow (e.g. interrupting generation).

## How this maps to AI engineering roles

Common requirements for AI engineering / ML platform roles and where each
one lives in the code:

| Requirement                                | Where it lives                                          |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

| RAG pipelines + retrieval optimization     | `src/rag_agent/retrieval.py` (hybrid + RRF)             |
| Vector database                            | `src/rag_agent/vectorstore.py` (Chroma, swappable)      |
| Evaluation framework (offline evals)       | `src/rag_agent/evals/`                                  |
| Evaluation datasets + test harnesses       | `data/eval_datasets/hr_full.yaml`, `evals/runner.py`    |
| Automated scoring pipelines                | `scripts/run_evals.py` with `--fail-under` for CI       |

| Containerization + CI                      | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/`|

---

## Testing

50 unit tests run with no API keys and no network access — LLMs are stubbed
at the module boundary so the entire graph and API can run in CI deterministically.

```bash
make test         # all tests with full output
make test-fast    # only the no-network suites
```

Coverage by module:

| Module                  | Test file                  | Coverage |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| State schemas           | `test_schemas.py`          | Contract validation |
| Hybrid retrieval / RRF  | `test_retrieval.py`        | Determinism, fusion math |
| Eval scorers            | `test_scorers.py`          | All four scorer types |
| LangGraph topology      | `test_graph.py`            | All three paths (retrieve / direct / refuse) + loop cap |
| Guardrails              | `test_guardrails.py`       | All filters + pipeline composition |
| FastAPI surface         | `test_api.py`              | Health, query, metrics, guardrail wiring |

CI runs lint (ruff), format check, type check (mypy), tests, and a Docker
build smoke test on every PR. See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Deployment

### Docker

The Dockerfile is multi-stage (builder + runtime), runs as a non-root user,
and ships with a Python-based healthcheck so orchestrators can detect
wedged processes. The compose file adds a persistent Chroma volume and a
one-shot `evals` service.

```bash
make docker-up           # start the API stack
make docker-down         # stop and remove
docker compose run --rm evals   # run the eval suite against the live API
```

### Environment variables

All config flows through pydantic-settings. The most relevant:

| Variable                  | Default              | Purpose                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`       | (required)           | Generation                       |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`          | (required)           | Embeddings                       |
| `APP_LLM_MODEL`           | `claude-sonnet-4-5`  | Generation model                 |
| `APP_TOP_K_DENSE`         | `8`                  | Dense candidates per query       |
| `APP_TOP_K_SPARSE`        | `8`                  | BM25 candidates per query        |
| `APP_TOP_K_FINAL`         | `4`                  | Chunks passed to the LLM         |
| `APP_MAX_ITERATIONS`      | `3`                  | Retrieve-grade loop cap          |
| `APP_ENABLE_QUERY_REWRITE`| `true`               | Toggle the rewriter              |
| `APP_ENABLE_GRADING`      | `true`               | Toggle the grader                |
| `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`       | (unset)              | Enable LangSmith tracing         |

### Production considerations not handled

- **Authentication.** The API has no auth layer. Add a JWT/API-key middleware
  at the FastAPI level before exposing it externally.
- **Rate limiting.** Per-user / per-IP quotas. `slowapi` is the standard
  choice. Wire into the same middleware as auth.
- **Concurrency.** A single uvicorn worker is fine for a portfolio demo; a
  real deployment wants multiple workers behind a load balancer, with
  Chroma replaced by a shared backend (pgvector, Pinecone) so workers don't
  fight over the local store.
- **Secrets.** API keys are read from env vars. In production, fetch from a
  secret manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) on startup.

## What I'd build next

The three things I'd prioritize if this became a real production project:

1. **Authentication + rate limiting.** A JWT middleware and per-user quotas
   are table stakes for any external-facing AI service. The pattern is well
   understood; it's just work I haven't done here.
2. **Streaming citations.** The answer prompt asks for `[source: file]`
   citations, but a real system should track which specific chunks
   supported which claims at the token level. Useful for hallucination
   detection in eval and for clickable source links in the UI.
3. **Evaluation dashboard.** The JSON output from `run_evals.py` and the
   benchmark results are structured, but reading them across many runs is
   tedious. A small Streamlit app that compares runs over time would make
   regressions much easier to spot.

A few things I deliberately *didn't* build and would flag up front in an
interview:

- **No fine-tuning pipeline.** Some roles list RLHF / LoRA as nice-to-haves.
  I chose breadth (eval + agent + RAG + API + guardrails) over depth in any
  one area. Fine-tuning without an eval framework to measure its effect is
  the wrong order anyway.
- **No multi-agent topology.** Some roles call for it. I think multi-agent
  systems are usually the wrong abstraction when a well-designed
  single-agent graph would do, and wanted this project to reflect that
  opinion.
